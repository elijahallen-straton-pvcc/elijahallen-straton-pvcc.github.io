                  <ul> Continous Testing: This is a testig technique in which developers and operations teams will test the software over the course of its development rather than after product is fully built in an effort to catch bugs early on and have less of them by the time of release. </ul>
                  <ul> Configuration Management: These are management teams built to test assets and track software builds to test. Often these teams will gain access to code, requirements, design documents, models, test scripts, and results in order to help build good systems that meet requirements with minimal administrative efforts. </ul>
                  <ul> Servic Virtualization: A simulated environment of the service systems that are missing or not yet completed which can enable teams to reduce dependancy and test sooner </ul>
                  <ul> Defect or "Bug Tracking": Automated tools which can help development by tracking defects and measuring their scope and impact, and also uncover related issues </ul>
                  <ul> Metrics and Reporting: Techniques involving reporting and analytics in order to allow for team members to share status, goals, and test results  </ul>
